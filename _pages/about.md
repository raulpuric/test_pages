I'm an NLP research scientist of american-born Colombian-Indian descent. My research focuses on understanding AGI and cognition through the lense of natural language - a product of human intelligence. As a researcher, educator, and entrepreneur I want to responsibly advance the human condition through AI. Contact me at raulpuric at berkeley dot edu.
